## Project Management Methodology

Trello Board Implementation for Streamlined Project Management
**Trello Board Implementation for Streamlined Project Management**

To enhance our project planning and execution, we strategically adopted Trello as our project management tool, leveraging its flexibility and the Kanban methodology to streamline our workflow. The Kanban approach, known for its visual task management system, allowed us to maintain a continuous flow of work while effectively minimising bottlenecks and disruptions throughout the project lifecycle.

By using Trelloâ€™s digital Kanban board, we ensured that every team member had a clear and transparent view of tasks at all times. This transparency was instrumental in prioritising tasks efficiently and holding team members accountable, as the status of each task was easily visible and up-to-date. The intuitive layout of Trelloâ€™s board empowered our team to make real-time adjustments and adapt swiftly to changes or unforeseen challenges, ensuring smooth progress throughout the project.

The flexibility of Trello enabled us to tailor the board to the specific needs of our project, allowing for a customized workflow that maximised efficiency and productivity. In addition, Trelloâ€™s automation features reduced the need for manual intervention, streamlining repetitive actions and significantly cutting down the time spent on administrative tasks. This setup was crucial in supporting continuous delivery, adhering to deadlines, and maintaining high standards of quality.

To ensure seamless execution, we carefully delegated tasks and responsibilities across our team, assigning roles based on individual expertise and project priorities. This clear distribution of tasks not only enhanced collaboration but also facilitated accountability, as each team member was fully aware of their responsibilities. By regularly tracking progress and adjusting priorities through Trelloâ€™s real-time updates, we maintained alignment and focus across the team, ensuring that every task moved forward efficiently.

Ultimately, the combination of the Kanban method with Trelloâ€™s adaptable digital platform created an organized, flexible, and highly effective task management system. This empowered our team to stay on track, maintain focus, and remain aligned, driving productivity from start to finish and ensuring the successful delivery of the project.

Our primary form of communication was via Discord, we created a dedicated server for the project for all related project discussions. We utilised the Lounge feature to discuss and test in real time

### Sprint 1

In Sprint 1 the tasks typically focus on setting up the foundation for the project, ensuring that the team had the necessary tools, access, and a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s objectives. This initial sprint included lots of planning, research, and preparation, as well as the first round of task implementation. The specific tasks varried depending on the project task.


### Sprint 2
In Sprint 2 we built on the foundation set from Sprint 1 and focused on the actual product set up and development, setting up the server and client repositories and starting the feature implementation, and refining processes. We continued the momentum from the initial planning and research phase while focusing more on executing deliverables, iterating on designs, and addressing immediate issues identified during Sprint 1.



### Sprint 3
Sprint 3 was focused on refining the product, making sure everything was working and fine tuning the way the app was utilised, so we had to make changes and enhance the features to suit, and ensuring that the initial functionalities from previous sprints are fully integrated and working as expected. We have a solid foundation and aimed to continue developing the product while testing, iterating, and fine-tuning.
